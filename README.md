# ContactsClient

A `DependencyClient` that provides an interface to Apple's [Contacts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts) API using async functions.

## Motivation

Interaction with [Contacts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/contacts) using modern swift 6. Contacts is unforgiving (runtime crash if you dont specifically check every field on the item)

## Installation

You can add ContactsClient to an Xcode project by adding it as a package dependency.
